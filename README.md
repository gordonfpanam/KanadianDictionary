# KanadianDictionary
A localization dictionary for Kerbal Space Program 1.3.0 and later that uses Canadian english. For instance, a 'meter' is a measuring device while a 'metre' is the SI unit of length.

There are also some flags for kerbalized Canadian entities, and agencies for many of these flags. Thrimm Aerospace is also represented here courtesy of Mark Thrimm and his excellent single-stage-to-orbit aircraft examples.
