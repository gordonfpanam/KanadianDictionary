# KanadianDictionary
A localization dictionary for Kerbal Space Program 1.3.0 and later that uses Canadian english. For instance, a 'meter' is a measuring device while a 'metre' is the SI unit of length. Requires the SwitchLanguage plugin from the KSP Community Localization Project:

https://github.com/KSP-Localization/SwitchLanguage

There are also some flags for kerbalized Canadian entities, and agencies for many of these flags. Thrimm Aerospace is also represented here courtesy of Mark Thrimm and his excellent single-stage-to-orbit aircraft examples.

Licensed CC-BY-SA-4.0. Includes parodies of real life companies; no representation of these companies is intended.

Installation instructions:

First install SwitchLanguage into your game's GameData folder, then copy the contents of this repository there. Overwrite the settings.cfg from SwitchLanguage with this one. Verify that en-ca is the localization chosen on the KSP main menu screen.
